# Natural Language Dates (Revived) 🌍

This is a **revived and improved version** of the popular "Natural Language Dates" plugin for Obsidian.
It brings the plugin back to life with a modern engine, true multilingual support, and smarter time handling.

## ✨ New Features in v0.8.0
* **🌍 Multilingual Support:** Now supports **English, French, German, Japanese, Dutch, and Portuguese**!
    * *Examples:* `@tomorrow`, `@in 20 minutes`, `@Next Monday`, `@next friday`.
* **🧠 Smart Time Parsing:** The plugin intelligently detects if you included a time in your sentence.
* **🔗 Hybrid Links:**
    * Dates without time: `[[2024-12-30]]`
    * Dates **with** time: `[[2024-12-30]] 23:45` (Keeps your graph clean!).

## ✍️ Usage

### Date Autosuggest
Type `@` (default trigger) followed by a natural date.

* `@today` → `[[2024-12-30]]`
* `@tomorrow` → `[[2024-12-31]]`
* `@in 20 minutes` → `[[2024-12-30]] 23:50`

Press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> to keep the original text as an alias (e.g. `[[2024-12-30|today]]`).
